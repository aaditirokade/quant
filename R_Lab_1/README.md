R Lab 1: Assignment

For our first lab, we'll be using data I uploaded tonight, GSS 2006 and GSS 2016, along with their codebook. 

We'll practice with the 2006 data, and your assignment is to repeat the process with the 2016 data. 
You will have two deliverables, the script file in R and the answers to the attached Word file as well. 

Please add both your first and last name to the filename for both items.
